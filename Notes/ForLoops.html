    <h1>For loops notes</h1>
    <p>The importance of for loops is to help you avoid wasting time typing or to performs actions that are beyond human capability.</p>
    <p>For example: Imagine where you had to manually type a million numbers to be displayed on the screen.it is practicay impossible and you would spend an eternity to just write down numbers</p>
    <p>With for loops you can do that with just a single line of code; How cool is that?</p>
    <h5>how for loop works</h5>
    <p>for loops accepts three parameters</p>
    <p>The first parameter is the initializer meaning the starting point</p>
    <p>The second parameter is the condition where you want your loop to end at "the endpoint"</p>
    <p>The third parameter is the the incrementer or decrementer. This basically specifies whether you want the loop to keep going forward or backwards</p>
    <p>remember to separate the loop with a semi-colon</p>
    <p>This is how a for loop looks like</p>
    <p>for(var i=0; i<=10; i++)</p>
    <p>the i can be anything; potato, mango anything you like to call your variable</p>
