    <h1>205. Isomorphic Strings</h1>
    <p>Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

        Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
        
        All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.</p>
        <p> 

            Example 1:
            
            Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
            Output: true
            Example 2:
            
            Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
            Output: false
            Example 3:
            
            Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
            Output: true</p>
